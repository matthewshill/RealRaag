Real Raag is a musical simulator for the Afghan Rubab (an instrument from the lute family) and aspires to inform and expose a culture ridden with war for over three decades.  The rubab is considered Afghanistanâ€™s national instrument.  The rubab can be dated back to 700th century A.D. and is the predecessor of the Indian Sorod.The Rubab has 3 melodic string (displayed in this app) 12-15 sympathetic string (not shown in app) and 2-3 drone strings.  The melodic strings are used to play melodies and the other strings are either strummed or simply not played.  The unique sound of the Rubab comes from the choice of wood, mulberry, the shape of the instrument, and the string arrangements.The Afghan classical music system is based on raga (melodic mode, literally translates to color) and most compositions are folkloric.  A teaching and interactive component is in the works and will hopefully follow in the next version of Real Raag.Check out the Rubab in Action here!  (Qais Essar, Anar Anar)
