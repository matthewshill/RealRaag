The Rubab is an ancient instrument and is the one true Afghan string instrument.  It is depicted in Pashtun (main Afghan Ethnic group) art and poetry.  It is the National Instrument of Afghanistan.The Rubab can be dated back to 600 CE.  Until recently, the Rubab was mainly used in ensembles to accompany the singer in Afghan Art Music.  Poetry and storytelling are huge elements in Afghan culture.  The nomadic people of Afghanistan would usualy trade stories, poems, gossip, and intelligence along the trade routes.  When the various armies of Kings, Warlords, and Dynasties march across the Pashtun lands in attempt to conquer Afghanistan, poems and stories were traded amongst the various groups they would come across.  It was common for travelers to carry Rubab with them, using the hook like headstock to carry them on their Shoulders.  Musicians would trade the Modes or Raags of their music with other musicians.  The tunings of the Rubab suggest that the instrument was originally built around the concept of original Pashtun Raags, making it a true instrument of the Pashtuns.Around the 1960's, Ustad(master) Mohammad Omar raised the status of the Rubab from an accompanying instrument to a solo instrument.  Along with various changes he made to the instrument to make it more functional as a solo instrument, he traveled across the world to show people the Afghan Rubab.  He traveled to American and European Universities to share his music.  At a time when Afghanistan was huge tourist attraction, the Rubab received international recognition.  Decades of War and music censorship has lowered the status of the Rubab both internationally and among Afghan people.  This App's aim is to Expose, Preseve, and Teach Afghan Classical music on the Rubab."Do you know what the voice of the rabab is saying?Come follow in my steps and find the way;Since through error you'll discover what's right,Since through questions you'll end up with answers."						-Rumi
